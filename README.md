# AzureAD-Sync-Hard-Links
This script originated from User D.G. here: https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/122371-hard-link-ad-accounts-to-existing-office-365-users-when-soft-match-fails 

The script requires MSOnline which you can find details on here: https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MSOnline

The script DOES NOT start with 'Connect-MsolService' which is required prior to execution. 

aadSync_HardLinks.ps1 is not a commandlet or function its just a script that you run. 

I do not recommend using this unless you have a firm understanding of what the ImmutableID is and why you are running this script. 

.USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
